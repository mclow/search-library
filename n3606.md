# Extending `std::search` to use Additional Searching Algorithms

Document #: N3606	(Updated at Bristol)

Marshall Clow 	[mclow.lists@gmail.com](mailto:mclow.lists@gmail.com)

_Note: This is an update of [n3411](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3411.pdf), presented in Portland. The major difference is a different interface for the search functions._

### Changes
* N3411 - Presented to LWG at Portland
* N3606 - Presented to LWG at Bristol; used new iterface for `std::search`
* N3606-2 - Updated at Bristol; Added standard wording (thanks, Daniel!), and simplified the default interface.

## Overview

`std::search` is a powerful tool for searching sequences, but there are lots of other search algorithms in the literature. For specialized tasks, some of them perform significantly better than `std::search`. In general, they do this by precomputing statistics about the pattern to be searched for, betting that this time can be made up during the search.

The basic principle is to break the search operation into two parts; the first part creates a "search object", which is specific to the pattern being searched for, and then the search object is passed, along with the data being searched, to `std::search`.

This is done by adding an additional overload to `std::search`, and some additional functions to create the search objects.

Two additional search algorithms are proposed for inclusion into the standard: "Boyer-Moore" and "Boyer-Moore-Horspool". Additionally, the interface for the search objects is documented so that library implementers and end users can create their own search objects and use them with `std::search`.

_Terminology: I will refer to the sequence that is being searched as the "corpus" and the sequence being searched for as the "pattern"._

## Search Objects

A search object is an object that is passed a pattern to search for in its constructor. Then, the `operator ()` is called to search a sequence for matches.

### Example
A search object that uses a very simple search algorithm might be implemented as:

		template <typename ForwardIterator>
		class sample_searcher {
		public:
			sample_searcher ( ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last ) :
				first_ ( first ), last_ ( last ) {}

			template <typename ForwardIterator2>
			ForwardIterator2 operator () ( ForwardIterator2 cFirst, ForwardIterator2 cLast ) const {
				if ( first_ == last_ ) return cFirst;	// empty pattern
				if ( cFirst == cLast ) return cLast;	// empty corpus
				while ( cFirst != cLast ) {
				//	Advance to the first match
					while ( *cFirst != *first_ ) {
						++cFirst;
						if ( cFirst == cLast )
							return cLast;
					}
				//	At this point, we know that the first element matches
					Iterator it1 = first_;
					Iterator2 it2 = cFirst;
					while ( it1 != last_ && it2 != cLast && *++it1 == *++it2 )
						;
					if ( it1 == last_ ) // matched the whole pattern
						return cFirst;
					++cFirst;
					}
				return cLast;	// didn't find anything
				}

		private:
			Iterator first_;
			Iterator last_;
			};


## Algorithms

### Default Search and Default Search with Predicate

This is a convienience function that allows users of the new interface to use the existing functionality of `std::search`. 

This searcher requires that both the corpus and the pattern be represented with forward iterators (or better).

### Boyer-Moore

The Boyer-Moore string search algorithm is a particularly efficient string searching algorithm, and it has been the standard benchmark for the practical string search literature. The Boyer-Moore algorithm was invented by Bob Boyer and J. Strother Moore, and published in the October 1977 issue of the Communications of the ACM, and [a copy of that article is available]( http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/publications/fstrpos.pdf); another description is available on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string_search_algorithm).

The Boyer-Moore algorithm uses two precomputed tables to give better performance than a naive search. These tables depend on the pattern being searched for, and give the Boyer-Moore algorithm a larger memory footprint and startup costs than a simpler algorithm, but these costs are recovered quickly during the searching process, especially if the pattern is longer than a few elements. Both tables contain only non-negative integers.

In the following discussion, I will refer to `pattern_length`, the length of the pattern being searched for; in other words, `std::distance ( pattern_first, pattern_last )`.

The first table contains one entry for each element in the "alphabet" being searched (i.e, the corpus). For searching (narrow) character sequences, a 256-element array can be used for quick lookup. For searching other types of data, a hash table can be used to save space. The contents of the first table are: For each element in the "alphabet" being processed (i.e, the set of all values contained in the corpus) If the element does not appear in the pattern, then `pattern_length`, otherwise `pattern_length - j`, where `j` is the maximum value for which `*(pattern_first + j) == element`.

_Note: Even though the table may contain one entry for each element that occurs in the corpus, the contents of the tables only depend on the pattern._

The second table contains one entry for each element in the pattern; for example, a `std::vector<size_t>(pattern_length)`. Each entry in the table is basically the amount that the matching window can be moved when a mismatch is found.
The Boyer-Moore algorithm works by at each position, comparing an element in the pattern to one in the corpus. If it matches, it advances to the next element in both the pattern and the corpus. If the end of the pattern is reached, then a match has been found, and can be returned. If the elements being compared do not match, then the precomputed tables are consulted to determine where to position the pattern in the corpus, and what position in the pattern to resume the matching.

The Boyer-Moore algorithm requires that both the corpus and the pattern be represented with random-access iterators, and that both iterator types "point to" the same type.

### Boyer-Moore-Horspool

The Boyer-Moore-Horspool search algorithm was published by Nigel Horspool in 1980. It is a refinement of the Boyer-Moore algorithm that trades space for time. It uses less space for internal tables than Boyer-Moore, and has poorer worst-case performance.

Like the Boyer-Moore algorithm, it has a table that (logically) contains one entry for each element in the pattern "alphabet". When a mismatch is found in the comparison between the pattern and the corpus, this table and the mismatched character in the corpus are used to decide how far to advance the pattern to start the new comparison.

A reasonable description (with sample code) is available on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore%E2%80%93Horspool_algorithm).

The Boyer-Moore algorithm requires that both the corpus and the pattern be represented with random-access iterators, and that both iterator types "point to" the same type.

### Calls to be added to the standard library

		template <typename ForwardIterator, typename Searcher>
		ForwardIterator search ( ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last, const Searcher &searcher );


		template <typename ForwardIterator, typename BinaryPredicate=equal_to<>>
		default_searcher<ForwardIterator> make_searcher ( ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last, BinaryPredicate pred = BinaryPredicate ());

		template <typename RandomAccessIterator, typename BinaryPredicate=equal_to<>>
		boyer_moore_searcher<RandomAccessIterator> make_boyer_moore_searcher ( RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last, BinaryPredicate pred = BinaryPredicate ());

		template <typename RandomAccessIterator, typename BinaryPredicate=equal_to<>>
		boyer_moore_horspool_searcher<RandomAccessIterator> make_boyer_moore_horspool_searcher ( RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last, BinaryPredicate pred = BinaryPredicate ());
		

### Example usage

		// existing code
		iter = search ( corpus_first, corpus_last, pattern_first, pattern_last );
		
		// same code, new interface
		iter = search ( corpus_first, corpus_last, make_searcher ( pattern_first, pattern_last ));
		
		// same code, different algorithm
		iter = search ( corpus_first, corpus_last, make_boyer_moore_searcher ( pattern_first, pattern_last ));

### Restrictions on comparison predicates

Boyer-Moore and Boyer-Moore-Horspool place restrictions on the use of predicates when searching. In particular, there must be a 1-1 mapping between values that compare as equal; in other words, for each value in the "alphabet" of the pattern and source, there can be only one value which compares equal.  

Case-insensitive comparison predicates, for example, are not allowed, because `pred( 'A', 'a')` and `pred ( 'a', 'a' )` both return true.

### Performance

Using the new interface with the existing search algorithms should fulfill all the performance guarantees for the current interface of `std::search`. No additional comparisons are necessary. However, the creation of the search object may add some additional overhead. Different algorithms will have different amounts of overhead to create the search object. The `default_search` objects, for example, should be cheap to create - they will typically be a pair of iterators. The Boyer-Moore search object, on the other hand, will contain a pair of tables, and require a significant amount of computation to create.

In [my tests](https://github.com/mclow/search-library), on medium sized search patterns (about 100 entries), the Boyer-Moore and Boyer-Moore-Horspool were about 8-10x faster than `std::search`. For longer patterns, the advantage increases. For short patterns, they may actually be slower. 

#### Test timings

These results were run on a MacBookPro (i5) computer, compiled with `clang 3.2 -O3`, and compared against libc++.  The corpus was about 2.8MB of base64-encoded text. All timings are normalized against `std::search`.

The titles of the test indicate where the pattern is located in the corpus being searched; "At Start", etc. "Not found" is the case where the pattern does not exist in the corpus, i.e, the search will fail.

### Sample Implementation

An implementation of this proposal, available under the [Boost Software License](http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt) can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mclow/search-library).

### Placement into the standard

We believe that the searcher functions should go into `<functional>`, and the specialization of `search` should go into `<algorithm>`. 

It would also be possible to put the searchers into `<utility>`. We think that since there are not function objects in `<algorithm>`, only algorithms, the searchers do not belong there.
